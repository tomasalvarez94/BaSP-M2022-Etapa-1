 # Trackgenix SA
The company Trackgenix SA provides software development services to other companies.
In the development of a web system which we will call "Trackgenix" that will facilitate the
registration of hours worked by each employee in each project and work team, we must start with the
HTML structure of the landing page of the system requested by the company.

## Usage
```
To enter the project index, download the entire project from the github repo. Both index and assets. Once downloaded, click on the index and it will open the project on the browser from the local file.
```

### Week 02

I created the HTML file with its syntax structure and tags.

### Week 03

Once made the HTML part, I begun the landing stylesheet on CSS. Because of this, I had to do changes on the structure, moving some internal sections.
